# Python_Blockchain

A blockchain implementation in Python only for study.

The Blockchain-python implements simple blockchain and transactions. Currently, the implementation already has mining, transaction, communication between nodes, and file persistence of blocks and transactions.
The communication between nodes is via rpc based on http, rather than p2p network. Because the implementation of P2p is more complicated, it is too complicated to understand the framework of blockchain.
The verification based on cryptography has not yet been realized, and the verification of blocks between nodes and the verification of transactions have not yet been realized.
